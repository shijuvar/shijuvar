## Shiju Varghese: Spiritual Teacher 

Shiju Varghese is a spiritual teacher who embodies a path rooted in the non-dual teachings of A Course in Miracles (ACIM) and the cultivation of insight through the practice of Satipatthāna Vipassanā meditation. He offers spiritual psychotherapy by synthesizing non-dual esoteric wisdom with the science of the autonomic nervous system and trauma-informed modalities, specifically integrating Polyvagal Theory and Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT). Shiju provides spiritual mentoring in ACIM, as well as in Satipatthāna Vipassanā meditation within the Theravada Buddhist tradition.
