## Shiju Varghese: Nervous System Coach and EFT Practitioner 

Shiju Varghese is a trauma-informed, polyvagal-informed Nervous System coach, Energy Medicine Healing practitioner, Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) Tapping practitioner, and practitioner and teacher of Mindfulness and VipassanƒÅ Meditation. He provides Brain-Mind-Body coaching and nervous system level healing to resolve stress, anxiety and trauma. He believes that the root cause of most of the chronic diseases is the chronic and traumatic stress that leads to dysregulation in the Nervous System and Gut Microbiome. Thus, by healing the nervous system from trauma which includes childhood trauma, we can achieve self-healing, greater health, and vitality, which can also achieve Gut health by combining with good diet. His primary interest lies at the intersection of science and spirituality, with a strong interest in Epigenetics, Neuroplasticity, Psychoneuroimmunology, Polyvagal Theory, Quantum Physics, Energy Medicine and Consciousness. He combines EFT Tapping and Dr. Stephen W. Porge's Polyvagal Theory for his healing practice.
