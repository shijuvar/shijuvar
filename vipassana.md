# Free Vipassanā Meditation Course

Shiju Varghese is providing free training and mentorship on Vipassanā meditation as a virtual training program. 

Vipassanā meditation or Insight meditation, is a meditation practice based on the teachings of the Buddha. 
The literal meaning of the Pali word Vipassana is that “seeing things as they really are”. The Vipassana meditation helps you to understand our inter-connected nature of reality by purifying the mind with wisdom, equanimity and compassion. Vipassanā meditation is a secular practice. You can practice Vipassana meditation regardless of your religious and spiritual beliefs.

The Vipassanā Meditation Course will be conducted in weekend days when there is a group of 5 people are available for the same. If you’re interested on this, please send me an email at shijuvar@gophermonk.in.

### A brief introduction about the teacher
Shiju Varghese has been practicing Vipassanā meditation since 2014. He started the Vipassanā meditation practice by following the teachings of the Venerable Mahāsī Sayādaw U Sobhana (1904-82), one of the most eminent meditation masters of 20th century, and a leader in the contemporary resurgence of Vipassanā meditation. His practice is also influenced by the teachings of many meditation teachers including Sayādaw U Tejaniya, Joseph Goldstein and Bhikkhu Anālayo. From an academic perspective, Shiju’s primary intrest lies at the intersection of science an spirituality. He is very much interested on Epigenetics, Neuroplasticity, Consciousness and Quantum Physics.
