## FAQ
**Q: What's the objective of the Masterclass?**

**A:** The objective of the Masterclass is not about learning some syntax and grammer, but it's all about how to write idiomatic Go code based on SOLID principles and Clean architecture. If you're passionate on programming and want to write production-ready Go code based on the Go philosophy and good engineering principles, the Masterclass will help you. 

The Trainer is not a  conventional trainer, but he is a senior Architect who has vast experience in building large-scale software systems, and thus the Masterclasses are designed for giving real-world insight with good software engineering philosophies. The Trainer is against the attitude that emphasize into syntax, frameworks and becoming the "poster child" of some named patterns without understanding the context of problem domain.  

**Q: How to enroll in the Masterclass?**

**A**: Send an email to shijuvar@gophermonk.in to confirm your slot for the Masterclass. Once your slot is confirmed, do make a payment of INR 1,000 to a UPI ID (UPI ID will be shared via email) just 1-2 days before starting the Masterclass. Please don't make the payment more than two days early of starting the Masterclass, a confirmation via email is fine. The conference details in Google Meet will be shared before starting the sessions. Once the Masterclass is started, and then, if you're comfortable with that, you can make the remaining payment and continue with the Masterclass. If you're not comfortable with Masterclass after attending the initial session, you can quit it. 
<b>Please note that Masterclasses are restricted to Indian developer community to keep compatibility among the audience</b>.  

**Q: What's the objective of the Masterclass Professional Go**

**A:** The objective of the Masterclass **Professional Go** is to learn Go programming language in a holistic manner by understanding the Go philosophy. The Masterclass will give you great insight about writing idiomatic Go code based on SOLID principles and Clean architecture. This may transform your entire career.  You can dive into production-ready REST APIs after attending this Masterclass. But, if your idea of learning Go is just about learning some Go syntax, and looking equivalent features in Go for the features, which you have learned in other programming languages, then the Masterclass will extremely disappoint you. 

**Q: Does a certificate provide after completing the Masterclass?**

**A:** No. The objective of the Masterclass is to provide a deep insight on Go programming language, but not about providing certificates. The trainer don't even believe in professional certifications, but emphasize in in-depth knowledge and the capability of writing idiomatic code that can only be applied in real-world projects.

**Q: I would like to join the Masterclass Professional Go, with a lot of baggages from my previous background, and thus I would like to learn Go by comparing with my previous experiences, which I have had with different programming languages. Can I join in the Masterclass?**

**A:** No. You can't join in the Masterclass. Please read the trainer's article [The Java Baggage: Biggest Bottleneck to Adopt Go in Enterprises](https://medium.com/@shijuvar/the-java-baggage-biggest-bottleneck-to-adopt-go-in-enterprises-2a37c80d72d9).

**Q: I'm currently working in a services company instead of a product engineering company. Can I join in the Masterclass?**

**A:** Yes, of course, you can join in the Masterclass. But, you may need to change some attitudes of services companies when you learn programming and architecture. 

**Q: I'm a fresher software engineer. Can I join in the Masterclass?**

**A:** If you're passionate on programming, you can join in the Masterclass regardless of your experience. In my mentoring experience, many fresher engineers learned and performed better than many senior people because they don't have any baggages in programming, and thus they are ready to learn when they get right mentoring. 

**Q: What's the objective of the Masterclass Distributed Systems Programming in Go**

**A:** The objective of the Masterclass **Distributed Systems Programming in Go** is to provide a great insight on distributed systems architectures, which include Microservices based architectures, Event-Driven architectures with distributed messaging and streaming. The Masterclass will also provide guidance extensively on NATS ecosystem, gRPC, and Go kit based development for distributed systems programming and Google Service Weaver. Google Service Weaver lets you write your Go code as a modular monolith, which can be deployed as either monolith or Microservices. 

**Q: My idea of Microservices is all about containerization, or just about building REST APIs, or just about using frameworks like SpringBoot, or about running applications with Serverless (a fancy name, IMO). Can I join in the Masterclass Distributed Systems Programming in Go**

**A:** No. You can't join in the Masterclass. This Masterclass is conceived Microservices as a distributed systems architecture based on the idea of functional decomposition, which starts from the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD).

**Q: Can I become an Architect by simply attending the Distributed Systems Programming in Go**

**A:** No. You can't. You can become a good architect only with several years of real-world experience on architecture. A good architect will never become a poster child of intellectual thoughts and named patterns, instead of it, he or she works on context-driven architecture based on the context of the systems (The biggest problem of our industry is architects are becoming poster childs). You can become a great Go programmer by simply attending the Masterclass Professional Go, but you can't become an architect by simply attending the Masterclass Distributed Systems Programming in Go. You may get solid understanding on distributed systems architectures from a pragmatic viewpoint with the Masterclass Distributed Systems Programming in Goo.    

**Q: Will the Masterclass Distributed Systems Programming in Go demonstrate infrastructure things like load balancing services, load balancing gRPC, setting up API Gateway, setting up Kubernetes Sidecar container and L7 proxy, etc?**

**A:** No. The Masterclass Distributed Systems Programming in Go is primarily focused on distributed systems programmig, but it does not focus on infrastructure concerns such as setting up and running services with larger clusters, and communicate between services using L7 proxies.     

**Q: Does the Masterclass provide recorded videos?**

**A:** No. 

**Q: If I miss a session due to an unexpected reason. What can I do?**

**A:** If you miss a session due to unexpected reasons such as internet connectivity issues or with any emergency situation, the trainer will provide guidance and One one One session on it based on his availability.

**Q: Does the Trainer give technical guidance after completing the Masterclass?**

**A:** The Trainer will give some technical guidance for your queries even after completing the training for some limited period of time, based on his availability. The Trainer will also review source code of the assignments and give feedbacks on code and architecture.
