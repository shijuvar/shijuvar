## FAQ
**Q: What's the objective of the Masterclass?**

**A:** The objective of the Masterclass is not about learning some syntax and grammer, but it's all about how to write idiomatic Go code based on SOLID principles and Clean architecture. If you're passionate on programming and want to write production-ready Go code based on the Go philosophy and good engineering principles, the Masterclass may help you. 

**Q: How to enroll to the Masterclass?**

**A**: Send an email to shijuvar@gophermonk.in to get the information and enrollment. You can register to the Masterclass by making a payment of INR 1,000. Once the Masterclass is started, and then, if you're comfortable with that, you can make the remaining payment and continue with the Masterclass. If you're not comfortable with Masterclass after attending the initial session, you can quit from it.

**Q: What's the objective of the Masterclass Professional Go**

**A:** The objective of the Masterclass **Professional Go** is to learn Go programming language in a holistic manner by understanding the Go philosophy. The Masterclass will give you great insight about writing idiomatic Go code based on SOLID principles and Clean architecture. This may transform your entire career.  You can dive into production-ready REST APIs after attending this Masterclass. But, if your idea of learning Go is just about learning some Go syntax, and looking equivalent features in Go for the features, which you have learned in other programming languages, then the Masterclass will extremely disappoint you. 

**Q: I would like to join the Masterclass Professional Go, with a lot of baggages from my previous background, and thus I would like to learn Go by comparing with my previous experiences, which I have had with different programming languages. Can I join to the Masterclass?**

**A:** No. You can't join to the Masterclass. Please read my article [The Java Baggage: Biggest Bottleneck to Adopt Go in Enterprises](https://medium.com/@shijuvar/the-java-baggage-biggest-bottleneck-to-adopt-go-in-enterprises-2a37c80d72d9).

**Q: I'm currently working in a services company instead of a product engineering company. Can I join to the Masterclass?**

**A:** Yes, of course, you can join to the Masterclass. But, you may need to change some attitudes of services companies when you learn programming and architecture. 

**Q: What's the objective of the Masterclass Distributed Systems and Microservices in Go**

**A:** The objective of the Masterclass **Distributed Systems and Microservices in Go** is to provide a great insight on distributed systems architectures, which include Microservices based architectures, Event-Driven architectures with distributed messaging and streaming. The Masterclass will also provide guidance extensively on NATS ecosystem, gRPC, and Go kit based development for distributed systems programming and Clean architecture. Go kit based development will improve the quality of the application architecture regardless of whether it's distributed systems or monolithic systems. 

**Q: My idea of Microservices is all about containerization, or just about building REST APIs, or just about using frameworks like SpringBoot, or about running applications with Serverless (a fancy name, IMO). Can I join to the Masterclass Distributed Systems and Microservices in Go**

**A:** No. You can't join to the Masterclass. This Masterclass is conceived Microservices as a distributed systems architecture based on the idea of functional decomposition, which starts from the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD).

**Q: Can I become an Architect by simply attending the Masterclass Distributed Systems and Microservices in Go**

**A:** No. You can't. You can become a good architect only with several years of real-world experience on architecture. A good architect will never become a poster child of intellectual thoughts and named patterns, instead of it, he or she works on context-driven architecture based on the context of the systems (The biggest problem of our industry is architects are becoming poster childs). You can become a great Go programmer by simply attending the Masterclass Professional Go, but you can't become an architect by simply attending the Masterclass Distributed Systems and Microservices in Go. You may get solid understanding on distributed systems architectures from a pragmatic viewpoint with the Masterclass Distributed Systems and Microservices in Go.    

**Q: Will the Masterclass Distributed Systems and Microservices in Go demonstrate infrastructure things like load balancing services, load balancing gRPC, setting up API Gateway, setting up Kubernetes Sidecar container and L7 proxy, etc?**

**A:** No. The Masterclass Distributed Systems and Microservices in Go is primarily focused on distributed systems programmig, but it does not focus on infrastructure concerns such as setting up and running services with larger clusters, and communicate between services using L7 proxies.     

**Q: Will the Masterclass provide recorded videos?**

**A:** No. 

**Q: If I miss a session due to an unexpected reason. What Can I do?**

**A:** If you miss a session due to unexpected reasons such as internet connectivity issues, I will provide guidance on it in week days.
